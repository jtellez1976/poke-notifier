# Fixes Summary - Global Hunt & Waypoint Tracking

## 🌍 **Global Hunt Button State Fix**

### Problem:
- Global Hunt button showed "OFF" in GUI even when system was enabled
- Status command showed correct state but GUI was inconsistent

### Solution:
- Changed default `isGlobalHuntSystemEnabled` from `true` to `false` in `PokeNotifierClient.java`
- Now waits for proper server synchronization before showing state

### Files Modified:
- `PokeNotifierClient.java`: Fixed default Global Hunt system state

## 🗺️ **Waypoint Tracking System Fix**

### Problem:
- Waypoint statistics not tracking newly created waypoints
- Auto-removal system not working because waypoints weren't being registered
- Clear tracked waypoints button had no effect

### Solution:
- Added `registerWaypointByName()` method to `WaypointTracker.java`
- Created `CommandInterceptorMixin` to intercept Xaero waypoint commands
- Updated waypoint registration system to track command-created waypoints
- Enhanced clear system to only remove mod-created waypoints (preserves manual ones)

### Files Modified:
- `WaypointTracker.java`: Added waypoint registration by name and improved tracking
- `MessageUtils.java`: Added tracking info to waypoint hover text
- `ClientCommands.java`: Added waypoint registration and Xaero command interceptor
- `CommandInterceptorMixin.java`: NEW - Intercepts Xaero commands for tracking
- `poke-notifier.client.mixins.json`: Registered new mixin

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Waypoint Tracking Flow:
1. **User clicks waypoint button** → Xaero command executed
2. **CommandInterceptorMixin** → Intercepts `xaero_waypoint_add:` commands
3. **WaypointTracker** → Registers waypoint name for tracking
4. **Statistics** → Now shows correct count of tracked waypoints
5. **Auto-removal** → Works when Pokemon are captured/die
6. **Clear tracked** → Only removes mod-created waypoints

### Global Hunt State Flow:
1. **Client starts** → `isGlobalHuntSystemEnabled = false` (default)
2. **Server sync** → `AdminStatusPayload` sends real state
3. **GUI updates** → Shows correct ON/OFF state
4. **Consistent display** → GUI and status command now match

## ✅ **Testing Checklist**

### Global Hunt:
- [ ] GUI shows correct ON/OFF state on first open
- [ ] Status command matches GUI state
- [ ] Button states update correctly during events

### Waypoint Tracking:
- [ ] Create waypoint → Statistics count increases
- [ ] Capture Pokemon → Waypoint auto-removed (if enabled)
- [ ] Clear tracked waypoints → Only removes mod waypoints
- [ ] Manual waypoints → Preserved when clearing tracked ones

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### Global Hunt Button:
- **No Event**: Shows "🟢 Disable System" or "🔴 Enable System"
- **Active Event**: Shows "⚠️ Event Active" (disabled)
- **After Cancel**: Returns to enable/disable state

### Waypoint System:
- **Create Waypoint**: Automatically tracked for auto-removal
- **Statistics**: Shows real count of tracked waypoints
- **Auto-Remove**: Works when Pokemon captured/die (if enabled)
- **Clear Tracked**: Only removes mod waypoints, preserves manual ones
- **Manual Waypoints**: Created outside mod are never auto-removed

Both systems now work correctly with proper state management and tracking.
