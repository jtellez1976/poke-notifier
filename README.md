# Poke Notifier v1.4.0 - The Complete Server Events Update!

Poke Notifier has evolved from a simple notification mod into a comprehensive server event management system! This latest version introduces powerful new event systems, enhanced administration tools, and seamless map integration, making it the ultimate tool for community servers running Cobblemon.

## 🌟 Latest Features in v1.4.0

### 🌪️ **Swarm Events System**
- **Mass Pokémon Spawning**: Create server-wide swarm events with 15-25 Pokémon of the same species
- **Smart Performance**: Pokémon only spawn when players are nearby, optimizing server resources
- **Guaranteed Shiny**: Every swarm includes at least one shiny Pokémon with boosted odds
- **Dynamic Levels**: Pokémon spawn at levels based on your server's player average (±10 levels)
- **Automatic Management**: Events end naturally when all Pokémon are caught or time expires

### 🌍 **Global Hunt Events**
- **Server-Wide Challenges**: Admins can start hunt events for specific Pokémon species
- **Competitive Rewards**: First player to catch the target wins special prizes
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Live updates on hunt progress and winner announcements

### 🗺️ **Xaero's Minimap Integration**
- **Automatic Event Waypoints**: Swarm and hunt events create map waypoints automatically
- **Smart Cleanup**: Waypoints are removed when events end or Pokémon are caught
- **Protected Waypoints**: Important event waypoints are protected from accidental deletion
- **Click-to-Navigate**: Clickable coordinates in chat for easy navigation

### 📊 **Advanced System Monitoring**
- **Live System Logs**: Real-time server monitoring with scrollable system status
- **Event Statistics**: Complete tracking of all server events and player participation
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor entity counts, player activity, and system health

## ✨ Core Features from v1.3.0

### 🎨 Unified GUI
- **One Command to Rule Them All:** The new `/pnc gui` command is now the single, universal entry point for both players and administrators. All other chat commands have been hidden to provide a clean, focused experience.
- **Elegant New Design:** The configuration screen is a sleek, centered panel that feels integrated with the game, not a disruptive full-screen menu.
- **Interactive Response Panel:** Command feedback is now displayed directly within the GUI in a temporary text box, so you no longer need to close the menu to see the results of your actions.

### 👑 Role-Based Interface
The GUI intelligently adapts to who is using it:
- **User Tools Tab:** All players have access to their personal settings, neatly organized into sub-categories:
  - `🔔 Notifications`: Toggle chat, sound, and HUD alerts.
  - `🎯 Custom Hunt`: Manage your personal hunt list with an interactive, clickable display.
  - `🏆 Catch 'em All`: Track your Pokédex completion for any generation.
  - `ℹ️ Info & Help`: View mod status, version, and configure the update checker.
- **Admin Tools Tab:** A separate, secure tab that is **only visible to OPs**. It provides a user-friendly interface for all server management commands, defaulting as the main view for admins to improve their workflow.

### 🛠️ Complete Admin Control via GUI
Administrators no longer need to memorize complex commands. Everything is now accessible with a click:
- **Server Control:** Toggle `Debug Mode` and `Test Mode`, and safely `Reload` or `Reset` all mod configurations (with confirmation prompts for dangerous actions).
- **Event Management:** Create and manage `Swarm Events`, `Global Hunts`, and `Bounty System` with full control over duration, rewards, and participants.
- **Player Data Management:** Easily select an online player from an autocomplete list to `Autocomplete` a generation's progress or `Rollback` their data from a backup.
- **Testing:** A dedicated panel to spawn any Pokémon for testing, with options for shiny, level, and location.
- **System Monitoring:** Real-time view of server status, active events, and system performance.
