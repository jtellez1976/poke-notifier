# Poke Notifier v1.1.0 - The Prestige & Events Update! is now live!!

Get ready for a completely new hunting experience! Version 1.1.0 brings dynamic event systems, a visual prestige system, and a huge number of quality-of-life improvements that make the mod more robust and fun than ever before.

## ‚ú® New Core Features

### üèÜ "Catch 'em All" Prestige System
The "Catch 'em All" mode has been completely revamped with a deep progression and reward system:
*   **Visual Ranks:** Show off your dedication! As you complete the Pok√©dex for each generation, your name in chat and above your head will gain a unique, colorful rank prefix that evolves with your achievements.
*   **3D Trophies:** Upon completing a generation, you will be awarded a **unique trophy** for that region. Place it in the world to display a slowly rotating 3D model that emits light and particles!
*   **Configurable Rewards:** Server admins can now define custom item rewards for players who complete each generation.
*   **Epic Celebrations:** Enjoy a **firework show** that grows in intensity with every Pok√©dex you complete. Masters who achieve it all will be shrouded in a unique aura of power!

### üéØ Autonomous Bounty System
The server now creates its own challenges!
*   The system will automatically post bounties for random Pok√©mon (from the RARE and ULTRA_RARE lists).
*   The first player to capture the target Pok√©mon claims the reward.
*   Fully configurable: Admins can adjust the frequency, probability, duration, and rewards for bounty events.

### üåä Autonomous Swarm System
The world now feels more alive than ever!
*   The server can now trigger **Pok√©mon Swarms** (10-15 creatures) in random, accessible locations in the Overworld.
*   A **global announcement** is sent to all players with the Pok√©mon's name, the biome, and the **exact coordinates** of the event, starting a server-wide race to get there first!
*   Admins can manually trigger swarms with the `/pokenotifier swarm start <pokemon>` command.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Rival System
Friendly competition has arrived.
*   When you're in "Catch 'em All" mode, if you capture a Pok√©mon that a nearby rival hasn't caught yet, that rival will get a private message letting them know you beat them to it!
*   An intelligent cooldown and proximity-override system prevents spam on busy servers, keeping the notifications relevant and fun.

### üîÑ Update Checker
*   The mod now checks if new versions are available on Modrinth or CurseForge.
*   Admins are notified in-game and can configure their preferred update source with a single click, no file editing required.

## üîß Technical Improvements & Fixes
*   **Data Security:** Player progress files are now encrypted to prevent manipulation.
*   **Automatic Migration:** Server configurations are automatically updated to new versions, preserving all admin customizations.
*   **Polished Commands:** The command interface has been cleaned up, hiding all internal commands from the autocomplete list for a cleaner admin experience.
*   **Visual Fix:** Fixed a bug that caused rank icons to be tinted by the color of chat text.
*   **Improved Compatibility:** Refactored all entity creation logic to use stable Cobblemon APIs, ensuring better future compatibility.
