# Poke Notifier v1.3.0 - The Unified GUI & Admin Tools Update!

This version introduces a massive overhaul to the user and admin experience by unifying all configuration options into a single, powerful, and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). The mod is now easier to use for players and significantly more powerful for server operators.

## ‚ú® New Core Features in v1.3.0

### üé® Unified GUI
- **One Command to Rule Them All:** The new `/pnc gui` command is now the single, universal entry point for both players and administrators. All other chat commands have been hidden to provide a clean, focused experience.
- **Elegant New Design:** The configuration screen is a sleek, centered panel that feels integrated with the game, not a disruptive full-screen menu.
- **Interactive Response Panel:** Command feedback is now displayed directly within the GUI in a temporary text box, so you no longer need to close the menu to see the results of your actions.

### üëë Role-Based Interface
The GUI intelligently adapts to who is using it:
- **User Tools Tab:** All players have access to their personal settings, neatly organized into sub-categories:
  - `üîî Notifications`: Toggle chat, sound, and HUD alerts.
  - `üéØ Custom Hunt`: Manage your personal hunt list with an interactive, clickable display.
  - `üèÜ Catch 'em All`: Track your Pok√©dex completion for any generation.
  - `‚ÑπÔ∏è Info & Help`: View mod status, version, and configure the update checker.
- **Admin Tools Tab:** A separate, secure tab that is **only visible to OPs**. It provides a user-friendly interface for all server management commands, defaulting as the main view for admins to improve their workflow.

### üõ†Ô∏è Complete Admin Control via GUI
Administrators no longer need to memorize complex commands. Everything is now accessible with a click:
- **Server Control:** Toggle `Debug Mode` and `Test Mode`, and safely `Reload` or `Reset` all mod configurations (with confirmation prompts for dangerous actions).
- **Event Management:** Enable or disable the `Bounty System` and manually trigger a `Swarm` of any Pok√©mon.
- **Player Data Management:** Easily select an online player from an autocomplete list to `Autocomplete` a generation's progress or `Rollback` their data from a backup.
- **Testing:** A dedicated panel to spawn any Pok√©mon for testing, with a simple checkbox to make it `Shiny`.
