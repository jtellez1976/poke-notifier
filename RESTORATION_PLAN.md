# Restoration Plan - Based on v1.3.1 Analysis

## Key Findings from v1.3.1:

### 1. **Panel Size & Layout**
- Original size: 420x260 (not 600x320)
- Response panel appears OUTSIDE main panel (below it)
- Suggestions render properly with renderSuggestions() method

### 2. **Missing Functionality**
- All buttons had immediate visual feedback + server networking
- Autocomplete worked with proper renderSuggestions() calls
- Spawn test had shiny checkbox (CheckboxWidget, not button)
- Player data had confirmation dialogs
- All admin toggles had immediate visual updates

### 3. **Key Implementation Details**
- Used CheckboxWidget for shiny in testing
- Had confirmation screens for dangerous actions
- Immediate button text updates for toggles
