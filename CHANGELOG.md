## üåç **Global Hunt System Enhancements**

- **Post-Restart Synchronization**: Improved event state persistence and synchronization after server restarts
- **Event Cancellation**: Added proper GUI refresh and state updates when cancelling active events
- **Smart Button Logic**: Buttons now enable/disable appropriately based on current event status

- Updated client-side state tracking in `PokeNotifierClient.java`
- Improved server-client communication for event status updates

### **User Experience:**
- Clear visual indication when events are active vs when system is available
- Proper button states prevent conflicting actions (can't start event while one is active)
- Immediate feedback when cancelling or starting events
